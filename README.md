# Auth-master
## What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- **Authentication Flows**: Implemented login, logout, and session management using NextAuth.js.
- **Providers**: Configured OAuth providers (e.g., Google, GitHub) and credentials-based authentication.
- **Session Handling**: Managed user sessions on both client and server sides, including protected routes.
- **Security Best Practices**: Learned about secure session storage, CSRF protection, and JWT handling.
- **Customization**: Extended the base tutorial by [mention any custom features, e.g., adding role-based access or a custom UI].

I also tackled challenges like [e.g., debugging provider configuration errors, understanding callback flows], which deepened my understanding of how NextAuth integrates with Next.js.

## Features
- 🔐 Login with multiple providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- 📝 Credentials-based authentication with email and password
- 🔒 Protected routes that require authentication
- [Custom feature 1, e.g., "Role-based dashboard for admins"]
- [Custom feature 2, e.g., "Custom error handling for failed logins"]

## Getting Started
To run this project locally:
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
