# Auth-master
## What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- **Authentication Flows**: Implemented login, logout, and session management using NextAuth.js.
- **Providers**: Configured OAuth providers (e.g., Google, GitHub) and credentials-based authentication.
- **Session Handling**: Managed user sessions on both client and server sides, including protected routes.
- **Security Best Practices**: Learned about secure session storage, CSRF protection, and JWT handling.
- **Customization**: Extended the base tutorial by [mention any custom features, e.g., adding role-based access or a custom UI].

I also tackled challenges like [e.g., debugging provider configuration errors, understanding callback flows], which deepened my understanding of how NextAuth integrates with Next.js.
